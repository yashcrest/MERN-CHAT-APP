# Chat Application (Socket.io) - [Under development]

The project layout is the following:

1. `frontend` React frontend with Vite
2. `backend` Nodejs frontend with Socket.io

## React Packages used

1. `Formik`: Formik takes care of the repetitive and annoying stuffâ€”keeping track of values/errors/visited fields, orchestrating validation, and handling submission
2. `Yup`: a schema builder for runtime value parsing and validation.
