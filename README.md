Project Structure:

1. `frontend` React frontend with Vite
2. `backend` Nodejs frontend with Socket.io

**Running Project Locally**
If you want to run both frontend and backend at one go

1. from root `cd backend`
2. `npm run dev` to start both backend and frontend at one go.

Package that made this possible : `concurrently`
